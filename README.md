# Getting-and-cleaning-data-project

At first we open the differents table available in the data repository except for the Inertial signal folder. Then we merge the activity labels table with the table that have the activities labels. Then combine this new table with the table that have the subjects id and add a new column that have the variable group that represent the group of the subject (train or test). After that delete the label column. Later, combine this table with the respective table that have the results and combine the two datasets, one with the test results and another with the train results. Next, select the features that represent the mean and standard deviation of each measurement and create a vector with the name of the column that have the total set table. Subsequently, select the column that have the data of the subjects and the measurments explain before. Finally, change the name of the column to have a descriptive name and sort the table base in the subject id.
